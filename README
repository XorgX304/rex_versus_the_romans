Rex versus The Romans
Anti Hacking Team Kernel Extension
reverser@put.as - http://reverse.put.as

This is a OS X TrustedBSD module to detect Hacking Team's OS X malware
in already infected systems or to warn if system is compromised by their dropper.

It assumes that the malware is written to /Users/username/Library/Preferences.
This assumption has been true in the past but unknown in the future.

The code is very simple and needs further improvements to be future proof to any
changes they might do. I do have that secret sauce but it's implemented in a 
commercial product. 

You are encouraged to improve on this code! Please tell me about it if you do.

Enjoy,
fG!
